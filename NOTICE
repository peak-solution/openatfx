openATFX Java Library - NOTICE

This library is based on the openATFX library by main author Christian Rechner, hosted on SourceForge, and develops this library further. This was discussed with him in advance and agreed on. This project has been modified to include additional features that are not part of the original work.

This project includes software developed by the Apache Software Foundation (http://www.apache.org/).

To fix an issue with the encoding used in the ORB, openATFX overwrites two classes from the Eclipse Glassfish ORB with changed versions, using the UTF-8 encoding instead of Latin-1. These classes are:
- com.sun.corba.ee.impl.encoding.CodeSetComponentInfo.java
- com.sun.corba.ee.impl.encoding.EncapsOutputStream.java
Note, that the dependencies to the Eclipse Glassfish ORB have to be provided by the runtime environment when using openATFX! See README.md or pom.xml for more details on the required libraries.
