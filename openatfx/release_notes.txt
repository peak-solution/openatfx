	These are the release notes of the openATFX library.
	

1. Changes

	0.4.0 (Christian Rechner)
	
		- Multiple performance tunings (up to 50% faster :-))
		- Fixes in memory consumption
		- Fixed bug in DAT2ATFX converter template application model
		- Update to JUnit 4.10
		- Update to woodstox 4.1.3

	0.3.1 (Christian Rechner)
	
		- The data type of base attributes "start_offset" and "flags_start_offset" now
		  be written to the ATFX
		- Added writing of "autogenerated" at application attribute
		- Implemented returning the unit at methods 'getValue' and 'getValueSeq'
		- Implemented reading external component files for data types
		  * DS_LONG
		  * DS_FLOAT
		  * DS_DOUBLE
		  * DS_COMPLEX
		  * DS_DCOMPLEX
		  and type specs
		  * dt_long
		  * dt_long_beo
		  * ieeefloat4
		  * ieeefloat4_beo
		  * ieeefloat8
		  * ieeefloat8_beo
		
	0.3.0 (Christian Rechner)
	
		- Completely changed the behaviour of creating application relations
		  the fulfil the ODS specification in automatically creating inverse
		  relations.
		  CAUTION: THIS MAY BREAK EXISTING CLIENT APPLICATIONS
		- Added skipping the implicit creation the 'AoExternalComponent' applElem
		  if no 'AoLocalColumn' application element exists.
		- Fixed incrementing the instance ids.

	0.2.2 (Christian Rechner)
	
		- Added ability to DIAdem DAT to ATFX converter to convert data sets
		  having different no of rows in the header file as in the binary data.
		- Added ability to change the datatype of an application attribute
		  derived from a base attribute. This necessary for several external
		  component attributes.
		- Removed wrong mandatory flag at attributes 'sequence_representation'
		  and 'generation_parameters' of 'AoLocalColumn'.

	0.2.1 (Christian Rechner)
	
		- Completed implementation of the DIAdem DAT to ATFX converter.
		- Added checking of having the right base relations in case of
		  multiple children.

	0.2.0 (Christian Rechner)
	
		- Enabled handling of LocalColumns having no values set.
		- Suppress writing of NULL attribute values.
		- Added DIAdem DAT to ATFX converter.
		- Implemented method "ApplElemAccess"->"deleteInstances".
		- Fixed method "isObligatory" of the interface ApplicationAttribute.
		- Fixed misspelling of ApplicationAttribute tag from "autogenerated" to "autogenerate".

	0.1.9 (Christian Rechner)
	
		- Further performance tunings.

	0.1.8 (Christian Rechner)
	
		- Performance tuning in method "getInstances" for pattern "*".
		- Performance tuning in methods "getValue" and "getValueByBaseName".
		- Several minor performance tunings.
		- Bugfix: Pattern of method "listAttributes" has not been taken into account for instance attributes.

	0.1.7 (Florian Steinberger, Christian Rechner)
	
		- Added limited query implementation.
		- Application attributes will now always be considered obligatory, if base attribute is defined as non-optional in the ODS 5.2 specification.
		- Fixed case insensitive lookup of base elements.

	0.1.6
	
		- Added workaround to read DIAdem ATFX files having the wrong relation range (100).
		- Added implicit creation of the application element 'AoExternalComponent', if missing.

	0.1.5
	
		- Fixed session close problem with JacORB.

	0.1.4
	
		- Ident XML output if context parameter "INDENT_XML=YES".
		- Omit writing of "<instance_data>" section if not instances available.
		- Added test for "InstanceElementIterator".
		- Fixed case sensitivity when comparing base attribute/relation names.
		  (Base element/attribute/relation names has to be compared case insensitive)
		- Fixed writing of LocalColumn values.
		
	0.1.3
	
		- Fixed FindBugs warnings.
		- Changed CORBA pattern of InstanceElement objects to FlighWeight using a ServantLocator.
		- Added memory leak detection test.
		- Performed memory leak test with 100000 session.

	0.1.2
		
		- Fixed parsing application relations with a base relation without relation range information.
		- Added ability to read application relations without having to information of the
		  inverse relation in the ATFX file.

	0.1.1
		
		- Fixed parsing of LocalColumn values of type A_TIMESTRING.

	0.1.0
		
		- Initial release.

2. Known Bugs
